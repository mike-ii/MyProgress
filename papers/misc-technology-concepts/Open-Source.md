# Open Source

>"Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration.
>Open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives beyond those of a single company." ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software))

### Importance of Open Source

The open source model has given rise to many prominent things in the computer industry. Open source code allowed for the creation and popularization of
[Linux](https://www.linux.org/) operating systems. Linux, or linux-like/linux based operating systems have found homes in virtually every device in the world (with the exception of Windows, and a few other things). For example, Android is a linux based operating system. Linux is most prominent in servers, but it's also used in many other things, from modems, cable boxes, televisions, embedded hardware and even toasters. It's important to note that "Linux" refers to the Linux kernel - not the operating system, but it is commonly used to refer to operating systems which run on the linux kernel, which is commonly accepted.

Linux is not the only win for open source. Many corporate applications and services impliment open source code, as well as fund open source projects. Open sourcing projects is a very effective, in that it lets thousands of programmers contribute at will, contribute based on their skills, and contributions are usually free.

Open source projects are usually free of charge, and anyone and everyone can view the code that they are running, as well as edit it themselves.

The term "Free Software" is often used to refer to open source software, but not in the monetary sense. Free Software doesn't always mean free of charge, it usually just refers to open source software that can be inspected and changed based on the users desires and needs.
