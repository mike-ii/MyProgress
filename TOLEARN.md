# To-Learn List

This is a list of everything I've come across but have
yet to learn. Once I have a general understanding of
a topic or concept I will check it's box.

Topic termonology might be wrong, but I'll fix the terminology when I learn about it.

I will also create a `.md` file for each topic covering my understanding of it.
