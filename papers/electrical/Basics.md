# Electricity Basics

To deeply understand electricity, you should learn how atoms and matter work, but for now all you really need to know is that there are positively charged particles, and negatively charged particles.

Both negative and positive particles are unstable, and naturally flow to a neutral state if they can.

Atoms contain protons (+) and electrons (-). If they have an equal amount of each, they are neutral and are unlikely to change, but if they have more protons, they are positively charged and desire more electrons to become neutral, while negatively charged atoms have too many electrons and need to get rid of them in order to become neutral.

The process in which electrons move from area to another is not relevant yet, but it's important to note that electricity flows from one charge to the other, and if there's a flow of electrons, then there is electricity.

If you'd like to understand this better, you can refer to this [article](https://www.douglaskrantz.com/ElecElectricalFlow.html).

Another thing to note is that electricity can be used to create a megnatic field, and vice versa, but don't be confused by that, I will cover that in another paper.

#### Direct Current (DC)

Direct current is the direct, uninterrupted stream of electicity on a wire.

#### Alternatinc Current (AC)

An alternating current is a current in which the flow of electicity constantly flips back and forth at a high frequency. 

#### AC vs DC

Fun fact: Thomas Eddison, who is famous for his uses of DC used Tesla's new invention (AC) to electecute an elephant to death to scare the public into not using alternating current, because Tesla was Eddison's rival.

Alternating current is more unstable and "violent" than direct current, so it is more useful in the long distance distrobution of power, and in devices that require a large amount of volitile energy, such as a lamp. Direct current is better for precision or delicate devices, such as an LED, or a computer.
